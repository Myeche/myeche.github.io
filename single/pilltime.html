                <p style="max-width: 400px;">For this student project, I was tasked with creating the UX and UI for an application that would help people suffering from chronic illness manage their medication by giving them daily reminders and allowing them to have automatic refills sent via mail. This application would help people keep track of the side-effects and the period of time in which they have been taking their medications.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p style="max-width: 400px;">I worked on my own on this project. I first established the required features for my application. I decided on daily reminders, possibility of refill and documentation on side-effects and interaction. After doing a competitive analysis, I realized that I should implement gamification to keep users engaged. I also decided to add a mood log to simplify the way people felt about their side-effects. I then developed personae that matched the wide audience that I wanted to target. I spent some time generating different user flow analyses; since my application was very deep, I wanted to make sure to get the most optimized UX. I then wireframed roughly in Balsamiq and developed higher fidelity wireframes in photoshop before creating an interactive prototype in InVision that I tested with users.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p style="max-width: 400px;">
                  During this project, to mock up the high fidelity wireframes, I had to use Photoshop, which is a good tool but not the fastest tool for this purpose. Furthermore, illness is a sensitive subject so it was hard for me to find volunteers for my user test within the classroom.
