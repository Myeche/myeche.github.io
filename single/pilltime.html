                <p style="max-width: 400px;"> For this student project,I decided to create the UX and UI for an application that would help people suffering from chronic illness manage their medication by giving them daily reminder and allowing them to have automatic refills send to mail. This application would help people to keep track of the side-effect and the range of time they have been taking their medications.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p style="max-width: 400px;"> I worked on my own on this project. I first established the required features for my application. I decided on daily reminder, possibility of refill and documentation about side-effect and interaction. After doing a competitive analysis, I realized that I should include a gamification to keep users interested. I also decided to add a mood log to simplify the way people felt about their side-effect. I then did personna that matches tohe wide audience that I wanted to target. I spent some time doing different user flow, since my application was very deep I wanted to make sure to get the most optimized UX.  I then wireframe roughly in Balsamiq and did higher fidelity wireframe on photoshop before having an interactive prototype in Invision that I test with some users.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p style="max-width: 400px;">
                   During this project I had to use Photoshop to mock up the high fidelity wireframes which is a good tool but not the fastest tool. Alo, illness is a sensitive subject so it was hard for me to find volunteer for my user test whithin my classroom.
